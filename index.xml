The course has 2 mandatory assignments, to be done in teams of two. The assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.
Help Sessions, Each assignment has 3 timetabled help sessions. Help sessions are the only time that you can help from the assistants. We will not give support at other times.</description></item><item><title>Grades and Credits</title><link>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/grades/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:15:13 +0100</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/grades/index.html</guid><description>Grades and Credits The two assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits). The assignment grade is as follows where $a_i$ is the final score of assignment $i$.
Grade Condition 5 $18 \leq a_1 + a_2 \leq 20$, no problem score $0$, guest lecture attened and $a_1,a_2 \geq 3$. 4 $14 \leq a_1 + a_2 \leq 17$, no problem score $0$, guest lecture attened and $a_1,a_2 \geq 3$. 3 $10 \leq a_1 + a_2 \leq 13$, no problem score $0$, guest lecture attened and $a_1,a_2 \geq 3$. A missed guest lecture (in case of no force majeure) can be compensated for by a summary of a research paper chosen by the head teacher.</description></item><item><title>Resources</title><link>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/resources/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:00:16 +0100</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/resources/index.html</guid><description>Computers at the IT Department Linux hosts
