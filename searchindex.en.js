    "content": "Help, Solution, and Grading Sessions and Guide for the Perplexed.\nThe course has 2 mandatory assignments, to be done in teams of two. The assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.\nHelp Sessions, Each assignment has 3 timetabled help sessions. Help sessions are the only time that you can help from the assistants. We will not give support at other times.\nInitial Grading For each problem of an assignment, your initial score, in the integer interval $0 \\ldots 5$, will normally be determined by the late afternoon on the day before the grading session for that assignment. Toward this, the assistants run your code on a grading test suite and examines the corresponding part of your report. An initial score is the final score if it is greater than or equal to $3$.\nGrading Session The objective of a grading session is to determine your final score for each problem with an initial of 1 or 2: your team will normally be given an appointment with an assistant during the grading session, in a room of her/his choice, toward correcting minor mistakes during that meeting and possibly increasing your score by one\nAppointment times are strict: the initial score is final in case of a missed appointment. Exceptions must be negotiated in due time during working hours with the head teacher, upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure.\nSolution Sessions The objective of a solution session is only for the assistants to discuss acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous deadline. No code will be handed out. The first solution session is merged with the initial help session to the second assignment.\nComments on your submitted report can be found at Studium; more detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon appointment.\nSubmission and Deadlines All assignment reports must be submitted via Studium. Submission deadlines are hard. The submission deadline and time in Studium is always correct (if it differs from information on this webpage). Exceptions must be negotiated in due time during working hours with the head teacher, upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure. Grading will only start after a deadline, so you can submit multiple times until then.\nEthics The legislation on plagiarism and cheating (summary) of Uppsala University will be rigorously applied, without exceptions. This disallows using a public repository (such as GitHub, where you should use a free private student repository) for code management within your team. We reserve the right to use plagiarism detection tools and point out that they are extremely powerful.\nYour report should be your own work, and not the product of a large language model. You should do the assignments without the use of an AI coding assistant.\nWhen submitting you implicitly certify that your report and all its uploaded attachments were produced solely by your team, except where explicitly stated otherwise and clearly referenced, that each teammate can individually explain any part starting from the moment of submitting your report, and that your report and attachments are not freely accessible on a public repository.\nWe reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading session.\nPlease report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.\nExpected Effort One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.\nThe assignments are worth 2 credits in total. Not counting the 21 hours spent on attending the lectures, the 2 assignments are calibrated to take an average of 30 hours each, for the average student, for each teammate, including the corresponding help, grading, and solution sessions.\nDo not expect the 2 assignments to be equally labour-intensive, and do not expect the 2 problems of each assignment to be equally labour-intensive.",

You can brute force the mathematics and just compute the complexity or can use the Accounting Method or the Potential method. Both the accounting method and the potential method give you mathematical tricks to estimate the total computational complexity for a sequence of $n$ operations.\nIn the lecture we will look at\nA rather artificial example of a stack where you can remove $k$ items in one go.

The exam questions will be drawn from the following list or will be very similar to questions in this list:\nProbabilistic Analysis: Exercises 5.2-{1,2,5,6} of CLRS4.\nRandomised Algorithms: Exercises 5.3-{2,3,4} of CLRS4.\nAmortised Analysis: Exercises 16.1-{1,3} of CLRS4; Exercises 16.2-{1,2} of CLRS4; and Exercise 16.3-2 of CLRS4.\nNP-Completeness: Exercise 34.5-2 of CLRS4 by following the hint in one step; Exercises 34.5-{5,6,7} of CLRS4; Problem 34-1ab of CLRS4 by following the hint in one step; Exercise 35.3-2 of CLRS4; and Problem 35-1a of CLRS4 by following the hint in one step; exercises not in CLRS4 (version of 2025-06-19).\nApproximation Algorithms: Exercises 35.1-5 of CLRS4; Exercise 35.4-2 of CLRS4; and Problems 35-{1bcde,3} of CLRS4.\nSince it is a closed-book exam, the questions will be asked in a self-contained way.\nExam study groups are allowed and even encouraged, as the exam is individual. The exam topics are taught as early as possible towards maximising the time available for exam preparation. Exam preparation sessions under the supervision of the head teacher (and assistants) cannot be organised, as that would 'burn' the CLRS4 questions tackled in such sessions.\nExpected Effort One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.\nThe exam is worth 3 credits. The actual preparation and taking of the exam are expected to take 52 hours. Recall also that 21 hours are spent on attending the lectures and that 60 hours are expected on working for the 2 credits for the assignments.\nAll this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.",
