Randomised algorithms is a big subject, which has many useful and efficient algorithms. Unfortunately, we will only scratch the surface.
We will cover
The hiring problem as a prototypical probabilistic problem Indicator Variables Linearity of expectation. Given two random variables $X$ and $Y$, then the expectation $E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$. The theorem is true for any distribution of $X$ and $Y$. This is perhaps one of the most useful theorems in probabilistic analysis of algorithms. Some examples of using indicator variables including the hat problem, the birthday paradox. Some randomised strategies for the hiring problem, or using randomness to avoid worst case run times. The algorithm for generating random permutations uniformly. We will not cover the proof of its correctness. Analysis of Hash tables including expected load factors and chain length. Universal Hashing. A randomised technique to build efficient hashing functions. Slides The information in the slides is spread out all over the place. I plan to use the whiteboard.
