slides demo of the dynamic table Amortised analysis can be quite difficult to understand first time around. The slides contain a lot of material and examples, but you are also encouraged to read Chapter 16 of the textbook. There are a few takeaways from this lecture
Amortised analysis is the time needed (in the computational complexity $O()$ sense) to do any sequence of $n$ operations, and hence gives you the average time complexity of a single operation. You can brute force the mathematics and just compute the complexity or can use the Accounting Method or the Potential method. Both the accounting method and the potential method give you mathematical tricks to estimate the total computational complexity for a sequence of $n$ operations.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-uk</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture4/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
