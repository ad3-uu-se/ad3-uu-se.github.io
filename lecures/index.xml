slides.
Reading Material The textbook does cover MIP, but there are many free (and non-free) resources. To do the assignment reader the slides is probably enough, but the following links are helpful.</description></item><item><title>Lecture 3</title><link>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture3/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:31:59 +0100</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture3/index.html</guid><description>Slides and Topics Today we look at Stochastic Local Search.

slides. Reading Material Again the book does not cover Stochastic local search. The slides should contain enough material to complete the assignment. but you can look at Coursera course Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimisation. The book Stochastic Local Search is a good general reference.</description></item><item><title>Lecture 4</title><link>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture4/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:55:59 +0100</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture4/index.html</guid><description>Today we are going to look at amortised analysis.
slides demo of the dynamic table Amortised analysis can be quite difficult to understand first time around. The slides contain a lot of material and examples, but you are also encouraged to read Chapter 16 of the textbook. There are a few takeaways from this lecture
Amortised analysis is the time needed (in the computational complexity $O()$ sense) to do any sequence of $n$ operations, and hence gives you the average time complexity of a single operation. You can brute force the mathematics and just compute the complexity or can use the Accounting Method or the Potential method. Both the accounting method and the potential method give you mathematical tricks to estimate the total computational complexity for a sequence of $n$ operations.</description></item><item><title>Lecture 7</title><link>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture7/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:31:59 +0100</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/lecures/lecture7/index.html</guid><description>Slides and Topics Today is a flipped lecture on SAT.
