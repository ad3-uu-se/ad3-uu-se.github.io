Software Resources Problem 1 (Assignment 1): Effortless and free access to MIP solvers is provided by the NEOS Server for Optimisation (search for “mixed integer linear programming”). We then recommend you use the world-class commercial MIP solver Gurobi Optimizer (or, but only in case of a temporary licensing issue with Gurobi at NEOS, the open-source MIP solver HiGHS), via the AMPL modelling language: when using the NEOS server, you do not need to install the AMPL integrated development environment (IDE) or AMPL command-line interface (CLI) or a MIP solver. Use a commands file with option gurobi_options 'outlev=1'; solve; # Write display commands here: display ___; in order to turn on verbose printing, which includes the optimality gap.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-uk</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://ad3-uu-se.github.io/assignments/assignment1/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
